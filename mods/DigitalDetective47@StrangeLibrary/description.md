# Strange Library: A Balatro Library mod

Strange Library is a Balatro mod that adds various new features for mods to use. This mod has been mainly developed to make features used by my content mod, [Strange Pencil](https://github.com/DigitalDetective47/strange-pencil), more available to the modding community at large.

Check [the wiki](https://github.com/DigitalDetective47/strange-library/wiki) for documentation on what's included and how to use the features in your mod. Remember to list `StrangeLib` as a dependency if you do!
