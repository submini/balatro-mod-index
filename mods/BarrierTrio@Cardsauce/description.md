# Cardsauce
A Balatro mod made for Vinesauce!

**Cardsauce** is a Vinesauce-themed expansion for Balatro, made in collaboration with the Balatro Discord and Vinesauce communities! Featuring art from several talented artists, Cardsauce adds 70 new Jokers, as well as a handful of other new additions to the game.

Detailed credits for everyone else who contributed to the mod can be found in-game in Cardsauce's credits tab in the Mods menu. There are too many names to list here and some credits spoil a bit of the stuff you'll discover in the mod, so just download it and see it all for yourself!
 A huge thank you to all the artists from Artcord Collaberative and the Vinesauce discord who joined the project, your help means the world! 💚
