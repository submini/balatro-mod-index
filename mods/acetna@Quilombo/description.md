Hello gamers

Balatro really inspired me to actually try my hand at game development, but for that I need to learn to code, and how to make art for said game. So that's the main point of the mod, learning!!!

Before this I had 0 experience in coding, and very little in making pixel art (A very basic TBoI texture mod nine years ago), and this whole mod was made in the last 2 weeks so any feedback is very appreciated.

I do plan to keep adding things to the mod over time, probably in bunches

# Additions
7 whole Jokers!!
