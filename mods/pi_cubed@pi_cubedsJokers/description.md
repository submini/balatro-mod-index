Adds a bunch of new vanilla-esque jokers that expand your choices in how you play and craft strong builds! All jokers and their art were personally developed by me, with a great amount of dev help from the Balatro Discord #modding-dev channel.

Most art currently is developer art, and many more jokers (at least 30!) and a few extras are planned to be added too (see the sheet).

## Config Options
A game restart is required for Config options to take effect.

### New Spectral Cards  
As of writing, this option simply enables or disables Commander from appearing. In future, this will also affect any additional Spectral cards I plan to add.

### Preorder Bonus' Hook  
Turn this option off to rework the Joker's mechanics very slightly to remove its hook that I (very jankily) implemented. This option may be useful if you're experiencing conflicts regarding setting the cost of Booster Packs.

### Custom Sound Effects  
Enables or disables any custom sound effects I've implemented into the mod. Currently, this affects Rhythmic Joker, Explosher, On-beat, Off-beat, and Pot.
