By Ice/IcyEthics

Requirements:

- Steamodded 1.0.0~BETA-0303a
- Lovely (>=0.7)

Balatro Goes Kino is a mod made to turn a game for poker nerds into a game for poker and movie nerds. It's main content is a large set of jokers inspired by movies, as well as new Enhancements and Tarot cards, with plans for boss blinds, challenges and decks.

### Current Content
- **175+ New Jokers**:  From hits like Titanic, E.T. and Iron Man to unnotable and unremarkable flops like The Three Musketeers (2011) and Krazy House. With many more jokers planned.
- **5 Enhancement:** A slew of new enhancements inspired by movie genres to help really sell that flavour. Sacrifice cards with Demonic cards, awaken monsters with Horror cards, fall in love with Romance cards, and more!
- **4 Genre boosters:** New joker boosters, containing only jokers of the given genre.
- **6 New Planets:** 6 strange new worlds from the silver screen.
- **New Consumable: Confections!** Popcorn, soda and cookies. Items to nourish your run and give them a little boost.
- **New Mechanics:** Earn extra joker slots by playing movies of the same genre. Start slinging spells. Even alien abduction!

### Planned Content

- *Even more card enhancements*
- *More Genre Boosters*

- *Real dumb film nerd mechanics.*
Get ready for jokers to get bonuses when they all share an actor, or the Kevin Bacon sticker, debuffing jokers if you don't own another joker that shares an actor with them.

- *Genre & Director decks.*
Increase the chances of associated jokers showing up, and start with a joker of that genre, or by that director.

### FAQ:
*I'm here to look at the code and see if I can learn from it for my own mod. What can I take?*
If the function credits any user that is not 'IcyEthics', you may want to ask that user if you can use their code. But otherwise, you're free to copy, adapt, improve or ruin any code in this repository. Same goes for art assets, unless they're credited to another user that isn't me. I'd love to receive credit, but it's not a necessity. As all the art in this mod is based on or traced from copyrighted materials, do be aware that you're not allowed to monetize the use of it. But I shouldn't have to tell you that technically I don't own Remy the rat from Ratatouille. If you end up using anything, I'd love to know about it, though, so please let me know!

*Is this mod balanced?*
Not yet, at least. I've not focused on balancing yet at all. Feedback on balancing is encouraged and welcomed!

*What other Mods is Balatro Goes Kino compatible with?*
None! Not intentionally, at least. You can definitely play it with other mods, and feel free to report compatibility related crashes, but be aware that the mod has not yet focused on compatibility with other mods.

*I found a bug, what do I do?*
Please let me know by opening a discussion here, or posting in the Balatro Goes Kino thread on the official Balatro discord. Or, if you want to follow and give feedback on the mod more actively, join the mod's discord: https://discord.gg/VDgzh3nW
